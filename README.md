# Challenge-product-preview-card-component
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) product preview card component HTML &amp; CSS challenge

# Description:

This challenge required a basic understanding of HTML & CSS. The goal was to recrate a product card using JPG images of the design files for reference.

# What I Learned (as a newbie):
**Coding is hard (even HTML & CSS)**
Understanding this difficulty allowed me to understand my aptitude for disipline, stress-response & mainly my ability to find a solution. The sources I used to work out bugs were [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

**If you think you have enough divs... add another one**

**I learned and implemented flexbox**
I was origionally trying to use floats and positioning to center the main container for the product card, but it was unsatisfactory. So I researched and read through mdn's flexbox documentation which worked immediately.

**I learned and implemented the id attribute**
I used this for the price amounts at the bottom of the card, then used inline-flex to get the two items side-by-side. I floated the first item left to complete the styling.
